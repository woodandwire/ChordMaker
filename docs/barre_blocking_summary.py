ðŸŽ¸ BARRE BLOCKING INTERFERENCE DETECTION ADDED ðŸŽ¸
=================================================

SPECIFIC PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Pattern 997896: [('O', 0), ('X', 0), ('4', 5), ('3', 2), ('3', 2), ('4', 5)]

Issue Analysis:
- Finger 3 (ring) barre: Fret 2 on strings 3rd (G) and 2nd (B)
- Finger 4 (pinky) barre: Fret 5 on strings 4th (D) and 1st (High E)

ðŸš« WHY THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE:
1. Finger 4 at fret 5 sits PHYSICALLY IN FRONT OF finger 3 at fret 2
2. This blocks finger 3's ability to press down on the strings
3. The barre for finger 4 "overrides" and blocks the barre for finger 3
4. Violates the principle that a barre should "expose 1 or more notes"

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
âœ… Added _rule_barre_blocking_interference() validation rule
âœ… Detects when higher-numbered finger barres block lower-numbered finger barres
âœ… Specifically checks for:
   - Adjacent fingers (3-4) with large fret gaps (â‰¥3 frets)
   - String overlap between conflicting barres
   - Impossible hand positions where fingers cross unnaturally

DETECTION LOGIC:
- Identifies all barres (same finger on multiple strings at same fret)
- Compares barre pairs for physical interference
- Flags as PHYSICALLY_IMPOSSIBLE when:
  â€¢ Adjacent fingers with â‰¥3-fret gap AND string overlap
  â€¢ Close fingers with â‰¥4-fret gap AND string overlap
  â€¢ Any finger trying to be at two different frets simultaneously

VALIDATION RESULTS:
âœ… Pattern 997896 now correctly flagged as PHYSICALLY_IMPOSSIBLE
âœ… Two complementary error messages:
   - "Anatomically impossible: 3-fret gap between adjacent fingers 3-4 (max 2 frets)"
   - "Barre blocking: adjacent fingers 3-4 with 3-fret gap creates impossible hand position"

âœ… Valid chords like F Major are not incorrectly flagged
âœ… System now properly enforces that barres must expose notes, not block them

IMPACT:
ðŸŽ¯ Prevents generation of anatomically impossible barre combinations
ðŸŽ¯ Ensures chord library contains only physically achievable patterns  
ðŸŽ¯ Protects musicians from attempting harmful finger positions
ðŸŽ¯ Maintains the principle that barres should enhance playability, not block it

The chord validation system now comprehensively detects both finger span
violations AND barre blocking interference for complete anatomical accuracy!
